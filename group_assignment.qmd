## Background

The data is patients with breast cancer. They are grouped into different categories; age, status after diagnosis, and gene expression levels (2905 different genes are measured).

## Aim

To investigate the correlation between expression level of the gene g1CNS507 and event after diagnosis.

## Load libraries

```{r}
library("tidyverse")
```

## Load data

```{r}
cancer_data <- read_csv(file = "data/gravier.RData")

```

```{r}
cancer_data
```

## Analysis

## Conclusion

More of the persons who have high expression of the gene g1CNS507 have no event after diagnosis compared to people who has lower expression of this gene.
